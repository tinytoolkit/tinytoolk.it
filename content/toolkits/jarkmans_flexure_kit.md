I made this for a Makevember, when I tried to make one example flexure from ['Handbook of Compliant Mechanisms'](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Handbook_of_Compliant_Mechanisms.html?id=XsCzpm1bZXEC&redir_esc=y) every day, out of card and tape.

So, I needed the tools to make quite complex and intricate little cardboard constructions, and I needed to be able to carry it around with me for speedy lunchbreak makes.

## Case
A plastic business-card case. Maybe from eBay ? 

## Contents
- Washi tape - thin, strong, flexible, restickable paper tape
