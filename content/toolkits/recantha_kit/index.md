## Contents

###  Exterior
The exterior of the case has some pockets, so I've added some sticky notes.

- 500 thin sticky notes or markers:

### Layer 1 - Multitool, scissors and penknife
My first layer is dominated by a fold-up multitool (see below), plus there's a pair of (rubbish) scissors and a Swiss Army knife.

It's quite a heavy kit, because of the multitools, but it's very handy!

As you can see in my Tiny Tookit, thereâ€™s a bit of duplication (especially box cutters!), but not much space left. I intend to expand the kit when I can to include an electrical-size screwdriver, some electrical tape and other stuff I can find as we go along and then get rid of the duplicates to make space.
