## Contents

###  Exterior
The exterior of the case has some pockets, so I've added some sticky notes.

- 500 thin sticky notes or markers:

### Layer 1 - Multitool, scissors and penknife
My first layer is dominated by a fold-up multitool (see below), plus there's a pair of (rubbish) scissors and a Swiss Army knife.

## Weight
It's quite a heavy kit at 1.9kg, primarily because of the multitools and the adjustable spanners, but it's very handy!

## Future
In this Tiny Toolkit, there’s a bit of duplication (especially box cutters and I certainly don't need two adjustable spanners in there!), but not much space left. I intend to expand the kit when I can to include a set of electronics screwdrivers, some electrical tape and other stuff I can find as we go along and then get rid of the duplicates to make space.
