A simple toolkit to fix my bike on the move. I keep it with me everyday whether for commuting or for long bike trips.

- A credit card because if everything fail, money is the key


With this kit I can fix almost everything on my bike. Lezyne tools are expensive but high quality. When you need your tools you don't want to have to fix them first.
