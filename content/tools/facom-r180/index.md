This thing does many different screwdriver things, while remaining very compact. I think it may be the tiniest way to be able to drive full-size bits.

I printed a [TPU clip](https://www.printables.com/model/694135-holder-for-facom-r180c-14-ratchet) to keep the two parts together, and a [TPU bit holder](https://www.printables.com/model/694147-compact-holder-for-14-bits)
